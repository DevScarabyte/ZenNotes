What Is This?

This is another notes mod.

The main advantage of this one is that it's open-source and I allow repacking so you have full control over it as a server admin, and it also allows you to select from several different font styles and colors (and you can easily add your own).

It also allows you to blacklist certain words that you don't want on your server. It will log all player notes to a logs folder including player names, SteamIDs and note locations to make it easy to moderate.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. It must be run on both server and client. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
